A core skier needs reliable gear for all-mountain adventures. The KORE pole supports any freeride experience with a steel tip for grip on hard snow, plus an easy-to-adjust strap around a Long Freeride Foam Grip that fits securely in a gloved hand. Aluminum adds durability without too much weight and the powder basket make powder days even better.Junior race enthusiasts can stay centered and recover easier thanks to the Raptor WCR 70's centered stance and absorption capabilities from HEAD's innovative use of thermoplastic. With a 96-mm last, a short cuff and long toe box for toe articulation, this boot's design comes from the feedback of Worldcup racers. Along with a FIS approved sole, the boot features Flex Performance tuning and Rear support tuning with an adjustable flex of 70 to 80. The Raptor WCR 70 delivers an athletic fit and responsive feel thanks to the JR WCR HF Pro liner with a lace-up option, a 45mm Velcro strap and four micro-adjustable low-profile racing alloy buckles.
The Oblivion line is inspired by HEAD's premier freeride athlete Cole Richardson, and the new Oblivion pole embodies freedom in the mountains. Made of lightweight yet strong aluminum, the Oblivion comes with two baskets to customize performance: a small, ergonomic basket for the park and pipe as well as a larger powder basket for big snow days. A race grip with easy-to-adjust powder straps enhances performance all over the mountain.
